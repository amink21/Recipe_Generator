# Recipe_Generator

This repository contains a simple and fun project â€“ a random recipe generator and its search version. The random recipe generator fetches a random recipe using The Meal DB API and displays detailed information, including ingredients, instructions, and an optional video recipe. The search version allows users to input a specific ingredient or dish, fetching and displaying matching recipes. Both versions are implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to integrate into any web application.
